{"pageProps":{"note":{"title":"Vegan","content":"I am vegan. These are some notes related to that topic. \r\n\r\n## Why\r\n\r\nVarious reasons, they have changed over the years. It's a good way to lower my carbon footprint. I don't need to eat animals, so I don't.It reduces the amount of animal suffering. I'm lactose intolerant. It helps me avoid making choices a lot of the time.\r\n\r\nIt's a constant reminder of my belief that pacifism is both a very important ideal to strive towards and is impossible goal to reach.\r\n\r\nI am constantly learning and re-learning how wrong it is to tell other people how to live or how to eat.\r\n\r\n### Less Meat Is Good\r\n\r\nIf you agree with the goals of vegans or want the health benefits, but want or need to eat some meat or other animals foods, you should. Don't listen to me, listen to your body.\r\n\r\nI think veganish achieves the goals of less industrial agriculture and less animal suffering, while being more practical for most people.\r\n\r\n## Food\r\n\r\n### Tofu\r\n\r\nI don't do recipes well, I just sort of vibe with what I have. Cooking Tofu is all about how dehydrated you get it before you cook it and what you rehydrate with during cooking. When you take it out of the package it tastes like water, you got to get the boring water out and replace it with better tasting water. Pressing or freezing the tofu gets all of the water out, then you put it in the pan with soy sauce and oil and possible sauce or vegetables while the tofu is still thirsty, so it gets filled back up with all of that delicious moisture.\r\n\r\n My wife, who isn't vegan or vegetarian, and I both like this brand [Gardein](https://www.gardein.com/). They do fake meat with soy and wheat ðŸ¦… and it is very good. Unclear how healthy it is or not, but it is very easy to prepare.\r\n\r\n### Non-Dairy Ice Cream\r\n\r\nCoconut milk. This is not debatable, the best non-dairy ice creams are made with coconut milk\r\n","slug":"vegan","references":[]},"slug":"vegan"},"__N_SSG":true}
