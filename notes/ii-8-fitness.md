Think of how the exercise fits the fitness goal and the environemnt. Fitness is connection ot the body. There are different exercises for different goals, fitting the exercise to the motivation is important.

Don't try and sit in 90 degree angle the whole time. Worry less about posture, more about time in a set place.

## YTW Stretch

With arms, make Y, T, then W. Keep shoulders flat, point thumbs back.

Straight spine. A healthy, curved spine feals straight

## Standup Stretch

From chair, put the feet on ground in front of chair, spread knees hip width. Hold arms and hands straight out, zombie-style. Push up slowly with the heals. Use the bum and back, not quads.

Sitting too long disconnects back and glute muscles from walking, strains the calfs/ quads.

## Creating Routines

Start with what you're doing and modify it. Map what you're doing and slowly add small amount of new things. Reframe exercise as small things to be more connected with the body. It's really helpful to work out with people, try it on Zoom.
