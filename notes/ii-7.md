3 phases in development of universe, in terms of scale:

1.Universe begins up to life emerges
2.Life emerges up until humans/general intelligence
3.Through current human civilization/progress

## Network Principles & Origins of Scaling

From [Scale by Geoffrey West: A brief summary](https://medium.com/swlh/scale-a-book-summary-3d39d16321ef)
> 1) Networks are space-filling. This means that the terminal units need to feed all cells in the body.
> 2) The terminal units are invariant.
> 3) The system is optimized, meaning that the energy used is the smallest it could possibly be given its design and network constraints.

It's worth reading Ingrouille's Plants: Evolution and Diversity if you're interested in how trees grow.

Carbon is the only element, at our conditions that forms long polymers -- for example DNA -- well.

At what scales can we visualize causality as circular?

Rain forests make for fast-cycling ecosystems. Soil breaks down fast at bottom. Large mamals recreate rain forest-like fast-cycling ecosystems, and move them to colder climates. Large mamals cahgne the fitness landscape. Evolution shifts from environment selecting organisms, the organisms select the environment.

Innovation cycles happen beacuse moving to new paradigms happen instead of singulatiries, which would lead to collapse. Cylce has to accelerate or it collapses or system has to change to very different dynamics.

Expansionist model -- humans expand to moon, Mars, etc -- is same mistakes again. It also doesn't match up with reality -- boom and bust cycle. Most of population gets wiped out, small groups perpetuate specices.

Emotions are short-lived. Holding them longer creates a cycle.
