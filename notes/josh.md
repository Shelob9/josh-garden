Hi, I'm Josh, an open-source software developer. I've spent the last several years as part of the WordPress ecosystem, committed to its mission of democratizing publishing. Before that I was a student of environmental studies and worked in the music industry. My passion is creating inclusive, accessible tools for thaught.

This is one of my two [[digitial-gardens]] sites. They are public notebooks, and beta versions of [Digital Garden Builder](https://docs.digitalgardenbuilder.app), a project I am working on, as part of [[meadow]].

The other garden is for software development notes, this garden is for other notes that do not fit there.

 build most of that with [[Laravel]] and [[React]], which is super fun.

I'm a nerd for this stuff, and spend a lot of time reading about how we think and create as an internet.
