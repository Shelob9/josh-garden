I am vegan. These are some notes related to that topic. 


## Food

### Tofu

I don't do recipes well, I just sort of vibe with what I have. Cooking Tofu is all about how dehydrated you get it before you cook it and what you rehydrate with during cooking. When you take it out of the package it tastes like water, you got to get the boring water out and replace it with better tasting water. Pressing or freezing the tofu gets all of the water out, then you put it in the pan with soy sauce and oil and possible sauce or vegetables while the tofu is still thirsty, so it gets filled back up with all of that delicious moisture.

 My wife, who isn't vegan or vegetarian, and I both like this brand [Gardein](https://www.gardein.com/). They do fake meat with soy and wheat ðŸ¦… and it is very good. Unclear how healthy it is or not, but it is very easy to prepare.

## Non-Dairy Ice Cream

Coconut milk. This is not debatable, the best non-dairy ice creams are made with coconut milk
